1. What question are you trying to answer? 

Are certain genres of movies associated with longer movie times? Certain themes? 

2. Why is this question worth answering? This can be either because it has some personal value to you or because it is a question that others are asking. If it is a question others are asking, then provide an example. 

The duration of a movie is a huge factor in a viewerâ€™s satisfaction. Knowing what factors correlate with movie lengths can help a viewer choose or rule out certain options when it comes to watching movies. 

3. What is your hypothesis? Why leads you towards that hypothesis? 

Are certain genres of movies associated with longer movie times? Certain themes? 

My prediction is that thriller and action movies are associated with longer times, based off of previous knowledge and experience. Comedy and romance movies are more likely to be shorter since they are more light-hearted and have less information to convey.  

4. What is the primary dataset(s) you will use to answer the question? The dataset(s) must be at least 15GB in their original form when downloaded. Provide links. You may not choose r/place (any year) as your analysis set.
